# Introduction

Operate is a Spring Boot application. That means all ways to [configure](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config)
a Spring Boot application can be applied. By default the configuration for Operate is stored in a YAML file `application.yml`. All Operate related settings are prefixed
with `camunda.operate`. The following parts are configurable:

 * [Elasticsearch Connection](#elasticsearch)
 * [Zeebe Broker connection](#zeebe-broker-connection)
 * [Zeebe Elasticsearch Exporter](#zeebe-elasticsearch-exporter)
 * [Operation Executor](#operation-executor)
 * [Authentication](authentication.md)
 * [Scaling Operate](importer-and-archiver.md)
 * [Monitoring possibilities](#monitoring-operate)
 * [Logging configuration](#logging)
 * [Probes](#probes)

# Configurations

# Elasticsearch

Operate stores and reads data in/from Elasticsearch.

## Settings to connect

Name | Description | Default value
-----|-------------|--------------
camunda.operate.elasticsearch.clusterName | Clustername of Elasticsearch | elasticsearch
camunda.operate.elasticsearch.host | Hostname where Elasticsearch is running | localhost
camunda.operate.elasticsearch.port | Port of Elasticsearch REST API | 9200

## A snippet from application.yml:

```yaml
camunda.operate:
  elasticsearch:
    # Cluster name
    clusterName: elasticsearch
    # Host
    host: localhost
    # Transport port
    port: 9200
```

# Zeebe Broker Connection

Operate needs a connection to Zeebe Broker to start the import and to execute user operations.

## Settings to connect

Name | Description | Default value
-----|-------------|--------------
camunda.operate.zeebe.brokerContactPoint | Broker contact point to zeebe as hostname and port | localhost:26500

## A snippet from application.yml:

```yaml
camunda.operate:
  zeebe:
    # Broker contact point
    brokerContactPoint: localhost:26500
```

# Zeebe Elasticsearch Exporter

Operate imports data from Elasticsearch indices created and filled in by [Zeebe Elasticsearch Exporter](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/tree/{{commit}}/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter).
Therefore settings for this Elasticsearch connection must be defined and must correspond to the settings on Zeebe side.

## Settings to connect and import:

Name | Description | Default value
-----|-------------|--------------
camunda.operate.zeebeElasticsearch.clusterName | Cluster name of Elasticsearch | elasticsearch
camunda.operate.zeebeElasticsearch.host | Hostname where Elasticsearch is running | localhost
camunda.operate.zeebeElasticsearch.port | Port of Elasticsearch REST API | 9200
camunda.operate.zeebeElasticsearch.prefix | Index prefix as configured in Zeebe Elasticsearch exporter | zeebe-record

## A snippet from application.yml:

```yaml
camunda.operate:
  zeebeElasticsearch:
    # Cluster name
    clusterName: elasticsearch
    # Host
    host: localhost
    # Transport port
    port: 9200
    # Index prefix, configured in Zeebe Elasticsearch exporter
    prefix: zeebe-record
```

# Operation Executor

Operations are user operations like Cancellation of workflow instance(s) or Updating the variable value. Operations are executed in multi-threaded manner.

Name | Description | Default value
-----|-------------|--------------
camunda.operate.operationExecutor.threadsCount| How many threads should be used | 3

## A snippet from application.yml

```yaml
camunda.operate:
  operationExecutor:
  	threadsCount: 3
```

# Monitoring Operate

Operate includes [Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready) inside, that
provides number of monitoring possibilities.

Operate uses this default configuration:
```yaml
# disable default health indicators:
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-health-indicators
management.health.defaults.enabled: false
# enable health check and metrics endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: health,prometheus
# enable Kubernetes health groups:
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-kubernetes-probes
management.health.probes.enabled: true
# add custom check to standard readiness check
management.endpoint.health.group.readiness.include: readinessState,elsIndicesCheck
# define 8081 as management port
management.server.port: 8081
# configure endpoints
management.endpoints.web.base-path: /
management.endpoints.web.path-mapping.prometheus: metrics
```

With this configuration Operate provides endpoints:

```<server>:8081/metrics``` Prometheus metrics

```<server>:8081/health/liveness``` Liveness probe

```<server>:8081/health/readiness``` Readiness probe

# Logging

Operate uses Log4j2 framework for logging. In distribution archive as well as inside a Docker image you can find two logging configuration files,
that can be further adjusted to your needs.

## Default logging configuration

* `config/log4j2.xml` (applied by default)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN" monitorInterval="30">
  <Properties>
    <Property name="LOG_PATTERN">%clr{%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}}{faint} %clr{%5p} %clr{${sys:PID}}{magenta} %clr{---}{faint} %clr{[%15.15t]}{faint} %clr{%-40.40c{1.}}{cyan} %clr{:}{faint} %m%n%xwEx</Property>
  </Properties>
  <Appenders>
    <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT" follow="true">
      <PatternLayout pattern="${LOG_PATTERN}"/>
    </Console>
	<Console name="Stackdriver" target="SYSTEM_OUT" follow="true">
      <StackdriverJSONLayout/>
    </Console>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <Logger name="org.camunda.operate" level="info" />
    <Root level="info">
      <AppenderRef ref="${env:OPERATE_LOG_APPENDER:-Console}"/>
    </Root>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```
### JSON logging configuration

This one is specifically configured for usage with Stackdriver in Google Cloud
environment. The logs will be written in JSON format to make them better searchable in Google Cloud Logging UI.
## Enable Logging configuration

You can enable one of the logging configurations by setting the environment variable ```OPERATE_LOG_APPENDER``` like this:

```sh
OPERATE_LOG_APPENDER=Stackdriver
```

Default logging appender is Console.

# An example of application.yml file

The following snippet represents the default Operate configuration, which is shipped with the distribution. It can be found inside the `config` folder (`config/application.yml`)
 and can be used to adjust Operate to your needs.

```yaml
# Operate configuration file

camunda.operate:
  # Set operate username and password.
  # If user with <username> does not exists it will be created.
  # Default: demo/demo
  #username:
  #password:
  # ELS instance to store Operate data
  elasticsearch:
    # Cluster name
    clusterName: elasticsearch
    # Host
    host: localhost
    # Transport port
    port: 9200
  # Zeebe instance
  zeebe:
    # Broker contact point
    brokerContactPoint: localhost:26500
  # ELS instance to export Zeebe data to
  zeebeElasticsearch:
    # Cluster name
    clusterName: elasticsearch
    # Host
    host: localhost
    # Transport port
    port: 9200
    # Index prefix, configured in Zeebe Elasticsearch exporter
    prefix: zeebe-record
#Spring Boot Actuator endpoints to be exposed
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: health,info,conditions,configprops,prometheus
# Enable or disable metrics
#management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled: false
```
